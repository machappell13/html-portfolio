<h1>ðŸŽ¥ The Best Movies According to Meg ðŸŽ¥</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of the moment</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>There are so many versions of this, but the one that I love the most is the 5-hour BBC production. 
    The story and dialogue is true to the book and the acting is great. That Colin Firth stare across the room!!</p>
<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>I love musicals, and the music in this is amazing. Every song was written with the goal of being anthemic, and it hit the mark. The choreography, especially in "From Now On," compels you to move and groove along!</p>
<h3>When Harry Met Sally</h3>
<p>This movie is such an iconic rom-com that is so quotable and relatable!</p>
